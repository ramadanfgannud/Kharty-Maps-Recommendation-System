# Kharty-Maps-Recommendation-System
Intelligent Information Retrieval


This project is about building a recommendation system to help users better navigate in Kharty Maps app. 

Kharty is a learning technique app where people create diagrams to memorize information visually. 



I built a social learning approach on Collaborative Filtering using mutual downloads as a similarity measure between 1155 maps for 1821 users. 

I recommended target users the most relevant diagrams according to not downloaded mapsâ€™ repentances among N nearest neighbors.

I obtained Content-relevant maps and expanded Search queries using 10933 terms from several languages by constructing Search Engine functions on Content-based Filtering

I used Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python and tf*idf normalized weights
